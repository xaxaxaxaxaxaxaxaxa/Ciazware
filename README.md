Ciazware (Citizen V5), is a project that was created by me and my friend slieepy, on june 6th, 2020. I worked from V1 - V4 until i changed the name.

To use the script, execute it in your exploit, then type "cmds" in the command bar, you can get the command bar by pressing ";". Then press F9, and scroll until you find the commands.
